    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I’m a second-year tech enthusiast with a passion for exploring new technologies. From cybersecurity to software development, I’ve dabbled in multiple domains, which has sharpened my problem-solving skills and taught me to adapt quickly. Right now, I’m diving deep into web development, building responsive and user-friendly applications. I love experimenting with tools and frameworks—basically, I like to fuck around and figure it out. My goal is simple: to keep exploring, creating, and making an impact through technology.</p>
